## Project Descriptions

### 1. Text Processing
**Example Projects**:
- **Word Frequency Counter**: Parses a text file, removes punctuation, and counts the frequency of each word. This project demonstrates file handling, string manipulation, and dictionaries in Python.
- **Text Sentiment Analyzer**: Uses NLTK to determine the sentiment of a given text input. Ideal for exploring Natural Language Processing (NLP) basics.

### 2. Data Processing
**Example Projects**:
- **CSV Data Aggregator**: Reads CSV files and performs basic data aggregation functions, such as summing, averaging, and filtering data based on conditions.
- **Excel Data Manipulation**: Reads and writes Excel files, creates pivot tables, and automates data cleanup tasks.

### 3. Web Scraping
**Example Projects**:
- **Simple Web Scraper**: Uses BeautifulSoup to scrape a website for specific content, such as headlines or product prices.
- **Automated News Scraper**: Scrapes multiple news sites, consolidates news articles, and saves them into a structured format for analysis.

### 4. Data Visualization
**Example Projects**:
- **Matplotlib Basics**: Creates simple plots, bar charts, and histograms using Matplotlib, covering basic visualization techniques.
- **Interactive Plotting with Plotly**: Demonstrates interactive data visualizations, including 3D plots and maps, using the Plotly library.

---

### 5. Machine Learning
**Example Projects**:
- **Linear Regression Model**: Implements a basic linear regression model using scikit-learn to predict housing prices.
- **Image Classification with CNN**: Uses TensorFlow/Keras to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that classifies images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

---

### 6. Automation and Scripting
**Example Projects**:
- **File Organizer**: A script that organizes files in a specified folder based on their file type, demonstrating file handling and automation.
- **Email Automation**: Sends automated emails with attachments using the smtplib library, showcasing email handling in Python.

---

### 7. Advanced Concepts
**Example Projects**:
- **REST API with Flask**: Creates a RESTful API for a small e-commerce site with user authentication, product management, and order processing.
- **Multi-Threading Example**: Demonstrates the basics of multi-threading in Python with a script that performs concurrent tasks.
- **Data Pipeline with Airflow**: Uses Apache Airflow to set up a data pipeline that automates data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes.
