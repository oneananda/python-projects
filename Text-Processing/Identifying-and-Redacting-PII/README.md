# Identifying-and-Redacting-PII (Personally Identifiable Information)

This Python script identifies and redacts Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as email addresses, phone numbers, and Social Security Numbers (SSNs) in a given text. The script uses regular expressions to detect PII patterns and replaces them with placeholders, ensuring sensitive information is not exposed.

## Features

- Detects and redacts:
  - **Email Addresses**
  - **Phone Numbers** (formats with or without country codes)
  - **Social Security Numbers** (SSNs)
  - **Credit Card Numbers**
  - **Dates of Birth (DOB)**
- Customizable to add or modify patterns for different types of PII.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**

No additional libraries are required, as this script uses only Python's built-in `re` library for regular expressions.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):

   ```bash
