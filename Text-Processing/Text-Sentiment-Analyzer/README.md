Uses NLTK to determine the sentiment of a given text input. Ideal for exploring Natural Language Processing (NLP) basics.

This Python program provides a simple implementation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for sentiment analysis. Using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis tool from NLTK, it evaluates the sentiment of a given text and classifies it as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
